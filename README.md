# Azure Mini Project 02

This mini-project was completed as part of Springboard’s Azure Synapse Analytics module. It follows a guided lab exercise focused on building an end-to-end ETL pipeline using:

- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Data Flows and Pipelines

## Project Overview

The ETL flow performs the following high-level tasks:

1. Load product data from CSV into a staging table.
2. Match and transform the data using data flows.
3. Load the final data into a curated `DimProduct` table.

## Notes

- This project mirrors the structure and logic of the provided Springboard lab.
- Dataset schemas and transformations were pre-defined in the lab.

## Artifacts

Included files:
- `End-to-end ETL.md` – Markdown notes capturing lab responses and reflections
- `Azure Synapse Screenshots.docx` – Visual documentation of pipeline steps
- `Azure Synapse Screenshots.pdf` – PDF version for easy viewing
